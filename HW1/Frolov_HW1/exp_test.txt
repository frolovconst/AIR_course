 overall server/client architecture for parallel execution, and specified the external interfaces and XML
 broadcast protocols. A paper describing the architecture was submitted to DAC 2006. Was responsible for
 the project planning and milestones. In particular designed and implemented the capacitance extraction
 module including a novel extensible pattern matching framework. Correlated the capacitance module
 against QuickCap and Simplex. Helped in the development of a Raphaelbased flow used for the automatic
 generation of the capacitance lookup tables used in the patternbased extractor.
- Implemented a C++ based GDSII scanner featuring a generic query language. This tool is used in many
 extraction and physical design verification flows at Sun.
- Maintained, supported, and further developed a Simplex based RC extraction flow. In particular

 down to the transistor level while others remain grayboxed. Contributed fundamental building blocks to
 the flow rewrite and helped in leading the team towards the development of a much more extensible and
 maintainable code base.
- Defined, implemented, documented, and maintained an incremental timing tool. This Perl based tool
 utilized wire models for incremental capacitance and resistance extraction and timing reruns. The tool was
 used for CTOs during tape out mode.
