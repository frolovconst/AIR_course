 is one of the two main research groups at the computer science department at Leiden University. In addition,
 as a member of the LIACS Scientific Council, I am responsible for steering the general direction of computer
 science research at Leiden University. My group's mission is to investigate new paradigms for the retrieval and
 understanding of multimedia information by developing new deep learning approaches.

Key Accomplishments
-      As project consultant to the "B-SET for Career Network" in Boston, a project of Massachusetts Advocates
 for Children, developed, designed and implemented a collective impact policy and practice collaboration
 among nearly 60 member organizations including Boston Public Schools, disability service organizations at
 local and state levels, workforce development intermediaries, youth development agencies, business partners,
 organized labor and the City of Boston.
- Developed, instituted, oversaw and monitored quality improvement processes and capacity building
 at Bostonâ„¢s three one-stop career centers during a period of volume growth from 11,000 to over 25,000
 customers. Despite volume growth and budget and staffing decreases, rates of customer satisfaction ranged
 between 90% and 96%. 
- Co-founded Emerge, the first batterer intervention agency in the country. Emerge continues to serve as a
 model for such programs.
For over 20 years I have been involved in organization development, change management and quality
 improvement in both the private and public sectors in settings ranging from grassroots organizations to
 hospitals and other non-profits. Prior to that I was trained as a clinical psychologist, completing my doctorate in
 1990. I was a founder of Emerge, the first domestic violence batterer intervention program in the country.
For nearly 17 years I worked at the Boston Private Industry Council on the development and implementation of
 workforce development initiatives. My work concentrated on the roll out of the first One Stop Career Centers
 in the country and the continuing evaluation and improvement of the products and services they offered.
