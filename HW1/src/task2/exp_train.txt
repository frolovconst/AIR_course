Software Engineer at Oracle

(2 years 10 months)
ŁDesigned Oracle Billing and Revenue Management Cloud Service Reference Implementation (BRMC RI)
 Chef automated installation framework, which includes the configuration to install, integrate and test a BRM
 Cloud service. Using the open-source Chef configuration management tool, BRMC RI builds development
 and production environments through unattended install processes that automatically integrate each product
 into the overall BRM Cloud service. Once the BRMC stack has been built, BRMC RI uses open-source
 Cucumber to run automated acceptance tests end-to-end through the full stack. These acceptance tests are
 written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style to ensure that they are testing valid business use
 case scenarios. BRMC RI has made measurable improvements to the automation of BRM Cloud service
 installation and configuration processes, including, for example, an automated system that rotates passwords
 every three months.
ŁImplemented BRM Cloud Stack using Docker containers to accelerate development lifecycle, facilitate
 distribution and collaboration within the development team, enable version control and components reuse,
 minimize the deployment footprint and overhead, and assist the team as they move through multiple phases
 of development (Dev, Test, QA, and Production), which enabled a more agile development environment. 
ŁDesigned the packaging/release process, continuous integration and testing solution for BRM Cloud service
 using TeamCity and SVN version control. After the tests have been run, the resultsŠincluding the stack
 traces of failed testsŠare reported back to TeamCity where they can be viewed and reviewed.
