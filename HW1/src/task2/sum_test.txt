Designed and implemented the first Google Global Cache (GGC, a CDN platform embedded in operator

 the CDN grow its scale several orders of magnitude into one of the largest in the world with GGC deployed
 today by several hundreds of carriers globally. Instrumental in bringing Software Defined Networking (SDN)

 team that collected the 65th Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for YouTube; but a couple of years later I
 am still at Google :P

Summary
We are, at times, a strange brew. But this is what works for us Š and inevitably, it works for our clients. The
 types of people who work at PARAGRAPH are strategists, anthropologists, artists, engineers, entrepreneurs,
 negotiators, students and builders. Herein lies our value. We are able to look at problems from many different
 perspectives and apply this diverse point of view to solutions for our clients.
When we respond to a client™s brief we don™t just think about the research they want to do. We think about
 their business and marketing objectives. Then we step back and think: how can we help them get there? Often,
 the answer is to blend the client™s proposed methodology with one of our custom "research experiments.ﬂ We
 believe that you get the best results and the freshest insight when you attack a problem from multiple angles.
How do we know? Because we used to be in the trenches, too. We've worked as strategists, planners, managers,
 art directors and designers in traditional settings. And now we work as a seamless extension of your strategy
 department. And we work to infuse the strategy proces with unbridled creativity.We™re happy to be white-
labeled or just work in the background. It doesn™t matter to us. Our job is to simply help you make your teams
 creative execution the best, most insightful work possible Œ no matter what it takes to get there.
