We are, at times, a strange brew. But this is what works for us Š and inevitably, it works for our clients. The
 types of people who work at PARAGRAPH are strategists, anthropologists, artists, engineers, entrepreneurs,
 negotiators, students and builders. Herein lies our value. We are able to look at problems from many different
 perspectives and apply this diverse point of view to solutions for our clients.
When we respond to a client™s brief we don™t just think about the research they want to do. We think about
 their business and marketing objectives. Then we step back and think: how can we help them get there? Often,
 the answer is to blend the client™s proposed methodology with one of our custom "research experiments.ﬂ We
 believe that you get the best results and the freshest insight when you attack a problem from multiple angles.
How do we know? Because we used to be in the trenches, too. We've worked as strategists, planners, managers,
 art directors and designers in traditional settings. And now we work as a seamless extension of your strategy
 department. And we work to infuse the strategy proces with unbridled creativity.We™re happy to be white-
labeled or just work in the background. It doesn™t matter to us. Our job is to simply help you make your teams
 creative execution the best, most insightful work possible Œ no matter what it takes to get there.

Summary
Currently I am an engineer and I recently obtained an MBA. My long term goal is to become a CEO and
 make a difference in the world one day so I believe having an MBA will help me get there. Throughout my
 MBA program I have developed many skills that will help me identify and solve hard and exciting problems,
 understand a business and its goals, have great presentation and communication skills, and be a great leader. 
Great leaders communicate well, they are passionate, they inspire others, they are creative, they are patient and
 they are honest. I believe that I possess these and many other qualities that make a leader effective and worth
 following. I love taking on a challenge and learning something new because as a result I always grow and
 become a better person. I work hard every day and I believe that today should be better then yesterday was. 
I stay positive in the best and worst situations because it always helps me make good progress. I love trying new
 things and I love a good routine. I worked hard my whole life to get to where I am today and I do not believe
 in failure. Whenever I fail I see it as a positive thing because I accomplish and learn something new. It also
 helps me narrow down which skills and areas I need to improve on. Whenever I succeed I feel accomplished
 and intrinsically rewarded. 
I never want to stop learning or being challenged in and out of my comfort zone. I enjoy listening to motivating
 speakers, reading about new technologies, learning about advancements in medicine, and keeping up with the
 stock market. I love working with people because it is fun, exciting, and adventurous. I always find it amazing
 how much people can accomplish when they work together and are open to change. I always enjoy spending
 time with my family and my friends.
