 overall server/client architecture for parallel execution, and specified the external interfaces and XML
 broadcast protocols. A paper describing the architecture was submitted to DAC 2006. Was responsible for
 the project planning and milestones. In particular designed and implemented the capacitance extraction
 module including a novel extensible pattern matching framework. Correlated the capacitance module
 against QuickCap and Simplex. Helped in the development of a Raphaelbased flow used for the automatic
 generation of the capacitance lookup tables used in the patternbased extractor.
- Implemented a C++ based GDSII scanner featuring a generic query language. This tool is used in many
 extraction and physical design verification flows at Sun.
- Maintained, supported, and further developed a Simplex based RC extraction flow. In particular
 implemented a mixed extraction option, which for the first time allows parts of the design to be extracted
 down to the transistor level while others remain grayboxed. Contributed fundamental building blocks to
 the flow rewrite and helped in leading the team towards the development of a much more extensible and
 maintainable code base.
- Defined, implemented, documented, and maintained an incremental timing tool. This Perl based tool
 utilized wire models for incremental capacitance and resistance extraction and timing reruns. The tool was

Software Engineer at Google

Search infrastructure-Best indexing and serving offering
Software Engineer at Oracle
April 2014  -  January 2017 
(2 years 10 months)
ŁDesigned Oracle Billing and Revenue Management Cloud Service Reference Implementation (BRMC RI)
 Chef automated installation framework, which includes the configuration to install, integrate and test a BRM
 Cloud service. Using the open-source Chef configuration management tool, BRMC RI builds development
 and production environments through unattended install processes that automatically integrate each product
 into the overall BRM Cloud service. Once the BRMC stack has been built, BRMC RI uses open-source
 Cucumber to run automated acceptance tests end-to-end through the full stack. These acceptance tests are
 written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style to ensure that they are testing valid business use
 case scenarios. BRMC RI has made measurable improvements to the automation of BRM Cloud service
 installation and configuration processes, including, for example, an automated system that rotates passwords
 every three months.
ŁImplemented BRM Cloud Stack using Docker containers to accelerate development lifecycle, facilitate
 distribution and collaboration within the development team, enable version control and components reuse,
 minimize the deployment footprint and overhead, and assist the team as they move through multiple phases
 of development (Dev, Test, QA, and Production), which enabled a more agile development environment. 
ŁDesigned the packaging/release process, continuous integration and testing solution for BRM Cloud service
 using TeamCity and SVN version control. After the tests have been run, the resultsŠincluding the stack
 traces of failed testsŠare reported back to TeamCity where they can be viewed and reviewed.
