Summary
Designed and implemented the first Google Global Cache (GGC, a CDN platform embedded in operator
 networks). Over time, led Google™s Content Delivery Network (CDN) efforts including GGC and oversaw
 the CDN grow its scale several orders of magnitude into one of the largest in the world with GGC deployed
 today by several hundreds of carriers globally. Instrumental in bringing Software Defined Networking (SDN)
 and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concepts to Google™s traffic engineering and edge networking
 infrastructure. Leading projects over the last few years that enable wireless operators to run their networks
 more efficiently. 
I'm also on the board of the open-source project CORD which aims to bring datacenter economics and cloud
 agility to the Telco Central Office. I hold more than a dozen patents and conference papers filed/granted/
published. My closest potential shot at stardom though was when I went to Los Angeles in 2013 as part of the
 team that collected the 65th Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for YouTube; but a couple of years later I
 am still at Google :P
