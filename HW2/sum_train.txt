Summary
Currently I am an engineer and I recently obtained an MBA. My long term goal is to become a CEO and
 make a difference in the world one day so I believe having an MBA will help me get there. Throughout my
 MBA program I have developed many skills that will help me identify and solve hard and exciting problems,
 understand a business and its goals, have great presentation and communication skills, and be a great leader. 
Great leaders communicate well, they are passionate, they inspire others, they are creative, they are patient and
 they are honest. I believe that I possess these and many other qualities that make a leader effective and worth
 following. I love taking on a challenge and learning something new because as a result I always grow and
 become a better person. I work hard every day and I believe that today should be better then yesterday was. 
I stay positive in the best and worst situations because it always helps me make good progress. I love trying new
 things and I love a good routine. I worked hard my whole life to get to where I am today and I do not believe
 in failure. Whenever I fail I see it as a positive thing because I accomplish and learn something new. It also
 helps me narrow down which skills and areas I need to improve on. Whenever I succeed I feel accomplished
 and intrinsically rewarded. 
I never want to stop learning or being challenged in and out of my comfort zone. I enjoy listening to motivating
 speakers, reading about new technologies, learning about advancements in medicine, and keeping up with the
 stock market. I love working with people because it is fun, exciting, and adventurous. I always find it amazing
 how much people can accomplish when they work together and are open to change. I always enjoy spending
 time with my family and my friends.

I have work experiences in quite a few projects inside Google Search, from crawl to indexing, mainly about
 improving search data quality using a technique I created. The technique enables us to generate regexp based
 URL patterns from trillions of URLs automatically. Using these url patterns, we group similar URLs together
 and use that to predict utility for web pages in crawl / indexing. I also built an infrastructure to serve billions of
 url patterns, which could support dozens of millions of URLs / sec in production environment. This work has
 turned out to be very useful, including several most important launches in related areas.
Currently, I am working with more people / teams to use the technique in more areas, like dup, spam, rank.
